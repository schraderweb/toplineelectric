   Remodel Home Electricians       </h2>




<p>Typically homes built in the ‘40s-‘50s-‘60s need more outlets and more lighting for things like dishwashers, microwaves, computers and entertainment centers. In fact, one home office desk could feature 8 or more pieces of electrical equipment that needs plugging in: computer, monitor, printer, keyboard, desk lamp, calculator, telephone fax and scanner. That’s already 9 plug-ins. There’s the laptop, pencil sharpener, radio, TV…that’s a lot of power and that’s only one workstation setup.</p>
<p>Security is one of the big concerns of homeowners today and for that Top Line Electric installs perimeter lighting, fire and burglar alarm systems, and motion-controlled lighting. The [northern Michigan electricians][1] at Top Line Electric install CCTV and card access systems, used both in high end residences and businesses and multi-family residential developments.</p>
<p>Some of the electrical features that residential homeowners are including in their remodeling projects—features that Top Line Electric routinely installs—are:</p>
